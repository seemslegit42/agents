title: Bulk Exports
description: Export data via our UI
---

Bulk exports are JSON or CSV files of all of the scraped data within a group or job.
You create bulk exports in our UI by selecting the group you want to export, and optionally selecting a job and/or a date you want to filter the data by.

Bulk exports are useful for getting a full snapshot of your data at a given point in time but our API exports should be the preferred export method for most use cases.

<Warning>Note: Running an export for a large group may take a very long time to complete.</Warning>
