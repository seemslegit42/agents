title: Handling File Downloads
---
Different types of file downloads require different code strategies. This page outlines various strategies you may take.

## Regular Download Links
Regular downloads occur when the file link is directly available within the HTML (typically in the `href` of an `<a>` tag). Clicking these links directly initiates a file download.

To handle these downloads:

1. Save the URL directly from the page.
2. Reworkd will then asynchronously visit and download the file. We use `curl-cffi` mimicking browser behavior when downloading the file.

```python
# Select the link element
link = await sdk.page.query_selector('a.download')

# Get the URL directly
href = await link.get_attribute("href")

# Save the URL, Lambda will handle the download
await sdk.save_data({"download_url": href })
```

## Indirect Download Links

Indirect downloads happen when the direct link isn't immediately visible but becomes available after clicking a button or link.

To handle indirect downloads:

1. Click the button/link to open the URL.
2. Capture and save the newly loaded URL.
3. Automatically navigate back.

```python
# Select element to open page
element = await sdk.page.query_selector('button.download')

# Capture the URL after clicking
download_url = await sdk.capture_url(element)

# Save URL for download via Lambda
await sdk.save_data({"download_url": download_url })
```

## JavaScript/Dynamic Downloads

Dynamic downloads occur when a file download is triggered by JavaScript events directly in the browser, without a direct URL.

To handle dynamic downloads:

1. Use `capture_download` method to trigger and capture the download directly in the browser.
2. Retrieve the file metadata (URL and title).

```python
# Select element triggering download
element = await sdk.page.query_selector('button.download')

# Capture download event directly
download_metadata = await sdk.capture_download(element)

# Save file metadata directly
await sdk.save_data({
    "attachment": {
        "download_url": download_metadata["url"],
        "title": download_metadata["title"],
    },
})
```

## Downloads Requiring Cookies/Session

Some sites require the download to occur within the same browser session that accessed the page, making AWS Lambda unsuitable.

In these cases:

- Follow the same approach as dynamic downloads, handling the download directly in the browser context using `capture_download`.
